This implies that, in any binary representation of the WTW, knowing how many importing and exporting partners a given country holds, turns out to be maximally informative, since its knowledge conveys almost the entire information about the topology of the network.
In other words, the patterns observed in the binary WTW do not require the presence of higher-order mechanisms as an additional explanation, beside knowledge of degree sequences. The fact that node degrees alone are enough to explain higher-order network properties means that the degree sequence is an important structural pattern in its own.

to analytically obtain the expected value of a given network statistic across the ensemble of networks that preserve on average some local properties, and are otherwise fully random.
