[[reconstruction network]]



In this work, we show the extent to which graph reconstruction—reconstructing a graph from its subgraphs—can mitigate the theoretical and practical problems currently faced by GRL architectures. First, we leverage graph reconstruction to build two new classes of expressive graph representations. Secondly, we show how graph reconstruction boosts the expressive power of any GNN architecture while being a (provably) powerful inductive bias for invariances to vertex removals

solving seven graph property tasks not solvable by the original GNN.
