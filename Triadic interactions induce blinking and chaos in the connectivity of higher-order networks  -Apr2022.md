geometry of networks
information diffusion


Ecological, biochemical and neuronal networks are characterized by triadic interactions formed by one node regulating the interaction between two other nodes.

Here, we show that the combination of positive and negative regulatory interactions turns percolation into a fully-fledged dynamical system where the giant connected component intermittently involves a different set of nodes, and the order parameter undergoes period doubling and a route to chaos.
