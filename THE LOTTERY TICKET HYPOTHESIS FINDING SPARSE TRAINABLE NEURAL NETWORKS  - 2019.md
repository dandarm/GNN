**The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that—when trained in isolation—it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations.**


We find that a standard pruning technique automatically uncovers such trainable subnetworks from fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward networks.
those that we find have won the initialization lottery with a combination of weights and connections capable of learning
these smaller networks do not train effectively unless they are appropriately initialized.
