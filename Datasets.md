- [ego-social networks](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Twitter.html) , to identify users social circles, as a node clustering problem on a userâ€™s ego-network, tha is a network of connections between her friends. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles (http://i.stanford.edu/~julian/pdfs/nips2012.pdf)
- [node embedding on github users](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/github-social.html)  for binary node classification, that is to predict whether the GitHub user is a web or a machine learning developer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13021.pdf)
- [Wikipedia vote network](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html) Datasets of vote for election of wikipedia admins, by predicting positive and negative links (https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/signs-www10.pdf) with high accuracy. They find insight into some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed links in networks, shedding light on theories of balance and status from social psychology, for instance the attitude of one user toward another can be estimated by their relationships with other members of the surrounding social network.
- [Amazon products network](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Amazon.html), based on _Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought..._ for community detection

##### Twitter social network data
We use two public datasets to evaluate our method: Twitter Social Honeypot Dataset (TwitterSH) (Lee, Eoff, and Caverlee 2011) and Twitter 1KS-10KN Dataset (1KS-10KN) (Yang et al. 2012). The two datasets contain labeled spammers and legitimate users collected on Twitter, along with their corresponding tweets. The 1KS-10KN dataset also contains the social network information, but the TwitterSH dataset does not. Hence we use an external Twitter social graph dataset [[Datasets#What is Twitter a Social Network or a News Media]] (Kwak et al. 2010) to extract social relations of the users in TwitterSH dataset.
