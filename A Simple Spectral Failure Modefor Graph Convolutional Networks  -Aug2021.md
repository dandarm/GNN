spectral signal analysis on networks

we present a simple generative model where unsupervised graph convolutional network fails, while the adjacency spectral embedding succeeds


To our best knowledge, our results provide the first
geometry characterization of GCN limitation under random graph models, which is an important aspect of unsupervised graph convolutional network that requires further investigation and improvement
