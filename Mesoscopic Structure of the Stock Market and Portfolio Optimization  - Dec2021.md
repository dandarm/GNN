**Back to basic portfolio optimization**

briefly review the classical Markowitz portfolio optimization scheme. (pg9)


Discussion and conclusions:
the mesoscopic structure of the stock market correlations that emerge after filtering out both microscopic (stock-specific noise) and macroscopic (market-wide trends) components. We showed that such mesoscopic correlations are the most stable over time, thereby encoding important information in the context of portfolio optimization.
Upon filtering out these unstable components, the market can be partitioned into internally positively and mutually negatively correlated communities of stocks. We proposed to use these stable mesoscopic communities to construct portfolios characterized by higher levels of reliability

performing the mesoscopic optimization while simultaneously accounting for the community to which a given stock belongs
