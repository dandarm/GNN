for weighted networks, motif analysis is still undeveloped.
introduce a sink node

the number of possible patterns increases super-exponentially

The significance of motifs occurrence in a system can
be tested comparing with a null model

search for an extension of the motif concept to the weighted case

intensity is computed as the geometric mean of the edge weights forming a specific binary pattern, while its ratio to the corresponding arithmetic mean represents the coherence.
the introduction of weights can, in some cases, completely reverse the significance profiles of the corresponding underlying binary motif


Frequent subgraph: The concept is slightly different from that of network motifs, even if the subgraph definition is the same.  weights exceeding a preset threshold to build binary network

**Random walks to measure motifs**
Using walks of different kinds is a common idea to reduce a network to a string of symbols. placing a walker on a random node and move it to neighbors according to some transition probabilities depending on node strengths or degrees.

we can find techniques based on random walks to identify network communities
