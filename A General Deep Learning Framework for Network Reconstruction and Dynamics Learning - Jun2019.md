[[CATEGORICAL REPARAMETERIZATION WITH GUMBEL-SOFTMAX  - Aug2017]]


Many complex processes can be viewed as dynamical systems on networks.

recovering latent network structure and dynamics from observed time series data are important tasks because it may help us to open the black box, and even to build up the model of a complex system automatically

the reconstruction of both network connections and the dynamics on it.

the interplay between the network topology and its dynamics[4 Boccaletti, S., Latora, V., Moreno, Y., Chavez, M., Hwang, D.-U.: Complex networks: Structure and dynamics. Physics reports 424(4-5), 175â€“308 (2006)].

the inverse problem of network science: revealing network topology from observed dynamics.

network reconstruction task: simultaneously reconstruct network topology and perform dynamics prediction from time series data of node states.

In this work we introduce Gumbel Graph Network (GGN)
