This paper explores adding attributes to such nodes and modeling those as signals on a graph.

Discrete signal processing (DSP) [77], [78], [79], [80], [81]  
studies time signals. Graph signal processing (GSP)1 [2], [3],  
[45] extends DSP to signal samples indexed by nodes of a  
graph. At a very high level, DSP, and therefore GSP, study:  
1) signals and their representations; 2) systems that process  
signals, usually referred to as filters; 3) signal transforms,  
including two very important ones, namely, the z-transform  
and the Fourier transform; and 4) sampling of signals, as well  
as other more specialized topics
