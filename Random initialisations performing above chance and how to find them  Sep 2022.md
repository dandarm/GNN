Entezari et al. [[The Role of Permutation Invariance in Linear Mode Connectivity of Neural Networks  - Jul 2022]]  they hypothesise that any two solutions found by SGD can be permuted such that the linear interpolation between their parameters forms a path without significant increases in loss.
we obtain direct empirical evidence that the hypothesis is true in fully connected networks.
we find that two networks already live in the same loss valley at the time of initialisation and averaging their random, but suitably permuted initialisation performs significantly above chance.
