## Networks at the Heart of Complex Systems
(http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/1#networks)


Complex means: composed on many interconnected indipendent parts

Complex Systems examples are our society, our brain, or every other system composed of many parts interacting in nontrivial way. It is extremely difficult to describe their behaviour only given the knowledge of the components. Their understanding, mathematical description, prediction, and eventually control is one of the major intellectual and scientific challenges of the 21st century.

Behind each complex system there is an intricate network that encodes the interactions between the systemâ€™s components:
- Living cells can do their functions thanks to the interactions between genes, proteins and metabolites
- The brain ability to perform reasoning and thinking is due to the neural network
- The spread of knowledge, ideas and behaviours in our society is determined by the network of our friendship and professional acquaintances
- Our modern communication system, the World Wide Web is a network of interacting devices carefully designed to allow constant and safe flow of informations.
- The power grid is able to supply and balance the energy load thanks to its network design
- The trade of networks is responsible for the prosperity of our society

All these examples are complex systems in the sense that a change in a part can have an unpredictable effect on the whole.
