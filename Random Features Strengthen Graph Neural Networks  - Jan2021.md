GNNs cannot distinguish some non-isomorphic graphs and they cannot learn efficient graph algorithms.
GNNs become powerful just by adding a random feature to each node
we show that the addition of random features enables GNNs to solve various problems that normal GNNs, including the graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph isomorphism networks (GINs), cannot solve.
