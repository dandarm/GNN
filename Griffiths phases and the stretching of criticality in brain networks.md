As critical behaviour requires a high degree of fine tuning to emerge, some type of self-tuning mechanism needs to be invoked
the singular critical point is replaced by an extended critical-like region that corresponds to a Griffiths phase

Stretched critical regions, stemming from structural disorder, yield enhanced functionality in a generic way, facilitating the task of self-organizing, adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms selecting for criticality
