DeepPocket graph convolutional reinforcement learning framework

Their structure may be represented by a graph in which the nodes correspond to the financial instruments, while the edges or links correspond to some pair-wise correlation function
yields a sequence of actions. These actions are defined as the amount of funds to be allocated to each asset forming the portfolio to increase the expected return on investment

The actor–critic algorithm consists of two components: one being associated with the policy while the other is associated with the value function. the actor–critic approach may be implemented with two online, trainable neural networks that work concurrently in tandem.
One of the most important innovations in this work is the introduction of a graph convolutional network for the actor and the critic in order to take advantage of the correlation (as well as the non-Euclidean space) existing in between the financial instruments
