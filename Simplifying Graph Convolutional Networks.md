SGC with no activation function

GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation



**A K-layer GCN is identical to applying a K-layer MLP to the feature vector xi of each node in the graph, except that the hidden representation of each node is averaged with its neighbors at the beginning of each layer**
