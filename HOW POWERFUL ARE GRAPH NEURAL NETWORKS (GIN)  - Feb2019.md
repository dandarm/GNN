they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the WeisfeilerLehman graph isomorphism test.






a provably maximally powerful GNN under the neighborhood aggregation framework..
 go beyond neighborhood aggregation (or message passing) in order to pursue possibly even more powerful architectures for learning with graphs
