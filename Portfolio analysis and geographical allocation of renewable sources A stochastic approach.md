### Introduction

The exploitation of planetary resources as infinite source, regardless of the environmental impact, should be heavily reconsidered. For this reason Green and Sustainable Economy is gaining importance as a concrete economic development model.
The European Union has implemented, in accordance with the post-Kyoto protocol, the package “Climate-Energy 20-20-20” which has three main objectives:  20% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels;  reaching the renewable share of 20% compared to the gross final consumption; improving energy end-use efficiency of 20% (Cucchiella et al., 2017). 
The implementation of such incentive policies favoured in the last years the spread of renewable energy sources (mainly wind and photo voltaic), considered almost inexhaustible while ensuring a drastically reduced environmental impact when compared to traditional sources.

With regards to the impact of renewable energy sources on the
power grid, production from intermittent renewable sources brings with it challenges in terms of matching demand and supply on a real time basis (Brouwer et al., 2014)

The limited programmability of solar and wind generation capacity has partly offsetting the environmental and economic advantage of such renewable sources (Facchini, 2017)
Battery storage is often cited as a definite solution to this problem but it is still expensive and hardly scalable (Weitemeyer et al., 2015)

A viable approach would be to find an optimal spatio-temporal allocation of renewable energy production sites, in order to reduce characteristic fluctuations of renewable energy power. Limiting the fluctuations would be beneficial in reducing the impact on the grid and on the storage systems.

With regards to the optimal management of renewable sources, in
recent years Portfolio Theories have found a set of interesting applications. Portfolio Theory is nowadays a widely accepted method for the selection of efficient energy generation portfolios (Bhattacharya and Kojima, 2012; Kruyt et al., 2009; DeLlano-Paz et al. 2017), and there are already example of application of such methods also to the Italian electricity market (Cucchiella et al., 2017). 


By analyzing the impact of the sources' production fluctuations and temporal correlation patterns, it is shown that geographical allocation of different types of renewal energy sources can reduce the energy needs for balancing the power system. (Scala et al. 2019)
In that work a new model is proposed to investigate the power output of renewable energy sources by means of Gaussian fluctuations with tunable correlations, analyzing the impact of production fluctuations via Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) analysis introduced by Markowitz (1959). 
Moreover a new framework is discussed, for the optimization of real non-Gaussian portfolio of renewable energy sources (both wind and solar) showing that and efficient configuration of renewable power plants is easily achievable through MPT.

That work is a starting point for this thesis, and here will be proposed an advanced tool for Portfolio Optimization Theory, drawing from Machine Learning techniques, and studying the performance of advanced models like GNN for this task.
