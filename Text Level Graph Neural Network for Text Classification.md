[[NLP]]

has been used in many tasks in NLP including text classification (Defferrard et al., 2016), sequence labeling (Zhang et al., 2018a), neural machine translation (Bastings et al., 2017), and relational reasoning (Battaglia et al., 2016)

Instead of building a single corpus level graph, we produce a text level graph for each input text. we connect word nodes within a reasonably small window in the text rather than directly fully connect all the word nodes

we proposed a new graph based text classification model, which uses text level graphs instead of a single graph for the whole corpus
