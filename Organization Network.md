Two networks are formed, that of Google and Apple employees working to create new patents. A link is made if two employees are co-author of a patent.  The bigger the node and the greater the number of patents.

We can see different shape in the two networks:
in Apple there is a small number of great innovators, while in Google innovation culture is more spread and democratic.

There is no study of degree distribution available.
