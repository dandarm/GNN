the key limitation of existing GNN architectures is that they fail to capture the position/location of the node within the broader context of the graph structure

if two nodes reside in very different parts of the graph but have topologically the same (local) neighbourhood structure, they will have identical GNN structure. GNN will embed them to the same point in the embedding space
