[[ReservoirComputing]]
[[Pooling]]



The first type is inspired by Reservoir Computing (RC) and generates new vertex features by iterating a non-linear map until it converges to a fixed point. The second type of layer implements graph pooling operations, that gradually reduce the support graph and the vertex features, and further improve the computational efficiency of the RC-based GNN.




Conclusions:
Our experimental evaluation focused on two different types of tasks.  
graph classification
dimensionality reduction task by visualizing the embeddings generated

a large collection of datasets for graph classification
