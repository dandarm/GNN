[Forecasting Global Weather with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07575v1.pdf)


They use GNN for Numerical Weather Prediction, after the success of [Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03409) for modeling physical systems by means of 3D meshes.
